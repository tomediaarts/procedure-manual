# Accessibility

We strive to create a space that is accommodating and easy-to-use for people who use assistive devices.

## Building Access via Lisgar Park

Our main entrance is on the north side of the building, opening up onto Lisgar Park. The park is accessible from all sides via gently sloping ramp, but is mostly level with the sidewalk.

The park is mostly flat, obstacle-free concrete. 

## Entrance

The main entrance to the building features three sets of doors. During good weather, doors are propped during the day and throughout public events. All of the doors open by pushing inward, not pulling. If you are arriving for an event, someone will be inside the entrance to assist you.

If you encounter any issues, please call or text (416) 879-8942  and someone will be happy to meet you.

## Second and third floor

All events and offices are located on the second and third floors, accessible via an elevator just inside the entrance. Interior galleries and event spaces are barrier-free.

## Washrooms

The ground floor washroom and toilet are wheelchair accessible.

There is a private accessible washroom on the second floor next to the all-gender washroom, and two accessible stalls in the shared washroom.

## Interpretive Assistance

If you require ASL interpretation or any other interpretive assistance, please contact us and we will do our very best to help.

We welcome and invite your feedback about how to make the space easier for you to use. Contact us in person, via phone or email with your suggestions or questions.

If you have any comments, questions, suggestions or complaints – we would truly love to hear them. Please contact us at [info@tomediaarts.org](mailto:info@tomediaarts.org).
