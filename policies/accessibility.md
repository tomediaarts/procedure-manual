# Accessibility

We strive to create a space that is accommodating and easy to use for everyone.

If you require interpretation, supervised childcare, or have any other access needs or questions, please contact [info@tomediaarts.org](mailto:info@tomediaarts.org) at least two weeks in advance. It is our practice to do everything we can to create a safe and accessible space.

## Building Access via Lisgar Park

Our main entrance is on the north side of the building, opening up onto Lisgar Park. The park is accessible from all sides via gently sloping ramp, but is mostly level with the sidewalk.

The park is mostly flat, obstacle-free concrete.

## Entrance

The main entrance to the building features three sets of doors. The far left doors will be unlocked during any scheduled event. The two sets on the right open into our ground-floor café, which closes daily at 6 p.m.

**All of the doors open by pushing inward**, not pulling. None of the doors are powered. If you require assistance with the door, please let us know ahead of time and we will meet you.

If you encounter any issues once you've arrived, please call or text \(647\) 689-6005 and someone will be happy to meet you.

## Second and third floor

All events and offices are located on the second and third floors, accessible via an elevator just inside the entrance. Interior galleries and event spaces are barrier-free.

## Washrooms

The ground floor washroom and toilet are wheelchair accessible.

There is a private accessible washroom on the second floor next to the all-gender washroom, and two accessible stalls in the shared washroom.

We use scent-free soap, and encourage all guests to attend our events scent-free.

## Interpretive Assistance

If you require ASL interpretation or any other interpretive assistance, please contact us and we will do our very best to help.

We welcome and invite your feedback about how to make the space easier for you to use. Contact us in person, via phone or email with your suggestions or questions.

If you have any comments, questions, suggestions or complaints – we would truly love to hear them. Please contact us at [info@tomediaarts.org](mailto:info@tomediaarts.org).
