### Diversity and Inclusiveness Statement

TMAC is a community that values and recognizes diversity, and defends and builds equitable experiences. We are committed to uplifting the work, identities and wellbeing of marginalized creators and to actively fighting racism, sexism, and oppression in all its forms.

We welcome and advocate for the presence and contributions of all people regardless of their gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, culture, abilities, ethnic origin, marital status, nationality, race, religion, education, or socioeconomic status. 

Prejudice, oppression, and discrimination are detrimental to the health and growth of our community and the individuals who are a part of it. Supporting the visibility of our diverse lives enhances the experiences of all community members. We recognize and honor our differences and vigorously defend TMAC as a safe and equitable space.

### Have a suggestion?

The terms we use to describe our experience are always changing, and we are always learning. We are eager to maintain and defend the safety and inclusivity of this community, so:
