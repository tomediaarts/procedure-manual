## Terms of Reference

* The committee is comprised of 5-12 members, including a chair, staff and member volunteers.
* A chair and co-chair should be designated at all times
* Attendance at 75% of meetings is required to retain committee membership.
* Members may be appointed to the committee by the chair or the board of directors
* All committee members should:
  * Demonstrate a commitment to building equity in media arts and recognize barriers to inclusion
  * Consider introductory and advanced anti-racism/anti-oppression training with our partner Toronto Hostels Training Centre
  * Be familiar with TMAC's conflict resolution procedures
  * Be familiar with TMAC's artistic and charitable mandate

## Chair

The chair of the committee can be any one member of the board of directors, or a volunteer appointed by the board as a representative of the Member organization. If the chair is a board member, these responsibilities are also set out in the role description for that director’s position.

The chair is responsible for:

* Scheduling the meetings
* Setting the meeting agendas
* Leading the meetings
* Recording and posting minutes
* Following up on action items
* Bringing motions to the board for approval

A co-chair must be appointed to fulfill the chair’s role as required.

## Procedures

* The committee should meet at least 6 times per year, but may meet as frequently as needed.
* Three members constitutes a quorum; chair or co-chair must be in attendance.
* Minutes should be posted to the committee’s Basecamp project in a timely manner.

Major new projects should be brought to the board for approval at a meeting of the directors, or if timeliness is an issue, sooner via Basecamp.

## Lines of Communication

To ensure transparency for current and future committee members, committee business must be communicated and documented \(in the case of offline conversations/decisions\) through a **dedicated Basecamp project** for the committee.

Additional Basecamp projects for committee projects may be created at the chair’s discretion. For example, the committee might start a new Basecamp project for a workshop series or seasonal program, or if curriculum or other content will be developed over time. Non-committee members, outside coordinators, and clients can be looped in to a subset of content.

The committee’s **dedicated Slack channel** should be used instead of email or Basecamp for roughing out ideas and general chatter about projects and scheduling.

Incoming programming proposals are received through a **public form on our web site**, and submissions are delivered to the events@tomediaarts.org **shared email inbox**.
