Major new projects should be brought to the board for approval at a meeting of the directors, or if timeliness is an issue, sooner via Basecamp.

## Lines of Communication

To ensure transparency for current and future committee members, committee business must be communicated and documented \(in the case of offline conversations/decisions\) through a **dedicated Basecamp project** for the committee.

Additional Basecamp projects for committee projects (e.g., capital projects) may be created at the chair’s discretion. Non-committee members, outside coordinators, and contractors can be looped in to a subset of content.

The committee’s **dedicated Slack channel** should be used instead of email or Basecamp for roughing out ideas and general chatter about projects and scheduling.

Incident reports, maintenance requests should be routed through the facilities@tomediaarts.org **shared email inbox**.
